🚀 Local API Testing CLI (Python)

A fast, lightweight, terminal-based tool for sending HTTP requests to your local API during backend development — built entirely with Python.

🎛 Interactive menu-based CLI

📝 Custom headers & JSON bodies

💾 Save requests and run them again

📜 View request history

⚙️ Configurable settings (colors, default host, timeout, etc.)

🔄 Clean & minimal terminal UI

🔍 Readable request/response formatting
